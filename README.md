# agent_model

The goal of this project was to model potential effects of vaccination for COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. An agent-based model with a vaccination parameter, among other parameters, was built to compare death rates, infection rates, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in both vaccination and non-vaccination conditions in the United States. The model showed that COVID-19 will still be an issue in the United States for a long period of time, although a vaccine does aid in reducing cases, deaths, and economic decline.
